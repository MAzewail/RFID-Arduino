# Arduino RFID Module

This repository contains an Arduino code for an RFID module based on the RFID-master library. The code allows you to read RFID tags using an Arduino board and an RFID module. It provides a simple interface to access the unique identification number (UID) of the RFID tags.

## Requirements

To use this code, you will need the following:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- RFID module (compatible with the RFID-master library)
- RFID tags or cards

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the code as a ZIP file.
2. Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from the [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
3. Connect the RFID module to your Arduino board. Refer to the documentation of your specific RFID module for the pin connections.
4. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to **File > Open**. Select the `RFID_Module.ino` file from the repository.
5. Upload the code to your Arduino board by clicking on the "Upload" button or pressing **Ctrl+U**.
6. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE by clicking on the "Serial Monitor" button or pressing **Ctrl+Shift+M**.
7. Make sure the baud rate in the serial monitor is set to match the baud rate specified in the code (default is 9600).
8. Hold an RFID tag close to the RFID module, and you should see the UID of the tag printed in the serial monitor.

## Usage

The provided code is a basic example that shows how to read the UID of RFID tags using the RFID-master library. You can modify and extend the code to suit your specific needs. Here are a few things you can do:

- Implement additional functionality such as storing the UID in a database or triggering actions based on specific UID values.
- Integrate the RFID functionality into a larger Arduino project.
- Modify the code to work with different RFID modules or libraries.
